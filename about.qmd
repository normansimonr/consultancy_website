My name is Norman Rodriguez, I like thinking.

I've never been very good at staying in one lane, always zigzagging through economics, politics, language, technology, philosophy, mathematics, music, graphic design... anywhere thereâ€™s an intriguing puzzle. This blog is where some of that restlessness ends up on the page.

Think of it less as a diary and more as a cabinet of curiosities: essays, observations, and thought experiments that test out new angles on familiar and unfamiliar questions.

If you like ideas that wander a little off the beaten track, you may feel at home here.

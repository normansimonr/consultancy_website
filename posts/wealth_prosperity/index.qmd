> The paradox suggested by this thought, namely, that all the economic process does is to transform valuable matter and energy into waste, is easily and instructively resolved. It compels us to recognize that the real output of the economic process (or of any life process, for that matter) is not the *material flow* of waste, but the still mysterious *immaterial flux* of the enjoyment of life.

Human beings, as creatures with both material and advanced psychological needs, are essentially distinct from all other species that have lived on the earth. While a chimpanzee or a dog may grow bored, especially in conditions of captivity or confinement, little is required to rouse them. Their needs are largely material, centred on preserving physical integrity and well-being. Humanity, by contrast, has from the beginning sought psychologically stimulating activity. Even among the earliest people, symbolic objects such as beads and ornaments were highly valued, to the point that wide-ranging trade existed among hunter-gatherer communities in Sub-Saharan Africa, despite the fact that they were often separated by hundreds of kilometres [@heritage2030144; @Crowther03052016]. Religion and shamanistic or animist beliefs are even more evident among prehistoric humans, since their traces remain with us today in many cave paintings around the world, including our own country. Unlike other animals, human beings have needs that reach *far* beyond the preservation of the body.

The very idea of *wealth* is therefore unusual. If people can live in comfort without possessing a great abundance of goods—that is, without being rich—why has the pursuit of wealth played such a dominant role in culture throughout history? A distinction may be drawn between prosperity and wealth. *Prosperity*, let us define it, consists in possessing sufficient material goods to enjoy lasting material well-being. *Wealth*, on the other hand, is the accumulation of material goods beyond prosperity—that is, beyond what is needed for a comfortable life. From this distinction it follows that, if prosperity satisfies humanity's physical needs, the purpose of wealth is *not* material well-being, but the fulfilment of *psychological* desires.

A related concept is *poverty*. One might say that a poor person is someone who does not have enough to be prosperous. And if economic development, as a moral imperative, necessarily entails reducing poverty, then development must aim to ensure that as many people as possible become prosperous, though not necessarily rich.

Of course, people may legitimately seek psychological fulfilment in countless activities other than economic enrichment. Some find it primarily in study, others in work, others in service, others in spirituality. In practice, psychological satisfaction usually arises from a mixture of these.

When someone passes the threshold of prosperity—whatever that means in their social and environmental context—yet continues to pursue psychological fulfilment in the ongoing accumulation of wealth, they are no longer furthering their own economic development (for in becoming prosperous, they are already developed). By creating demand or investment, they may well stimulate development for others who remain in poverty and who benefit from working directly or indirectly for them. Yet when an entire society crosses first the threshold of poverty and then that of prosperity, moving into the realm of wealth, there is a grave risk that people, as experience repeatedly shows, will place their entire sense of psychological well-being in the pursuit of luxury. In other words, society risks becoming consumed by greed, so that not only the wealthy but also the prosperous and even the poor seek, at any cost, to maximise their possessions—not in order to live well, but to be rich.

Beyond the social harms that a greedy society can bring (since greed by its nature drives people to commit injustices against others whenever gain is at stake, regardless of whether the greedy are poor, prosperous or rich), there is a still more fundamental issue that must not be ignored. The ecosystem on which we depend provides resources to which humanity has only limited access, and its regenerative capacity is finite. When human populations were small, greedy societies—including ancient empires—endangered their own ways of life and those of subject peoples, but not necessarily all other civilisations and species on earth. The population growth of recent centuries, combined with the growing tendency of all social classes to pin their psychological needs on greed, has led to a visible environmental overload of the planet. Theorists such as Boulding and Georgescu-Roegen (quoted in the epigraph) warned of this in the twentieth century, and today a growing number of scientists and climate activists have joined them.

The problem, as Leonardo DiCaprio’s documentary *Before the Flood* also emphasises, is not a lack of data or evidence. Just as an excessively thirsty person will drink contaminated water (knowing it is contaminated, yet compelled by urgent physical need), so too will the greedy person destroy themselves and others in order to satisfy the compulsion that greed imposes. For this reason, someone determined to become rich will not desist, no matter how much scientific evidence, theoretical reasoning, or moral argument is set before them, because they have allowed wealth to become a basic psychological necessity. And this greed, as has been said, is not the exclusive preserve of business leaders or dominant classes, but is found across all walks of life—even among those struggling for subsistence. What motivates many modern revolutionaries, to cite one example, if not envy of the *wealth* of others, when a better life would require no more than prosperity? In modern societies, when a political leader dares to implement policies that limit large sections of the population from reaching a standard of living comparable to that of the wealthy, their electoral support often diminishes. Not only because the already wealthy withdraw their backing, but also because those who are not rich feel deprived of what they perceive as their right to reach similar levels of wealth.

From the two classes we had with Professor Gonzalo Manrique, together with DiCaprio’s documentary and Georgescu-Roegen’s text, I am left with the impression that the problem of climate change has its roots in morality, not in the absence of scientific progress. If many people refuse to accept that the environment must be protected and that injustices committed in the name of wealth must be challenged, I do not believe it is because they fail to understand the evidence or doubt its reliability, but rather because they do not wish to accept it—since acceptance would bring unbearable psychological suffering: the renunciation of what they have made a fundamental part of their life’s purpose, the pursuit of wealth.

How to resolve this problem remains an open question. Binding political decisions could in theory be taken, such as the measure that successfully banned chlorofluorocarbons in the late 1980s, which prevented the ozone layer from continuing to degrade at the alarming pace it had been. At that time, for nearly twenty years, chemical industries—especially DuPont, the makers of CFCs—resisted regulation tooth and nail, claiming there was no evidence that CFCs were destroying the stratosphere. When the evidence finally became undeniable, governments around the world acted with surprising speed and determination. Yet replicating that experience today is far more difficult. Replacing CFCs was relatively straightforward; climate change is not as immediately visible as the ozone hole once was; and fossil fuel industries wield immense lobbying power, reinforced by the fact that many developing countries rely on oil and coal exports for their survival and that of their political elites. Moreover, even if national measures were taken in a democratic country, their effect would at best be negligible (since the largest emitters are non-democratic states) and, at worst, they would be repealed by later governments to placate social discontent over the resulting economic slowdown.

In large measure, the world’s future does not lie in our hands, but in those of the Communist Party of China—just as in war the outcome depends less on the soldiers than on the generals’ strategy. That said, I do not believe we are powerless. We can certainly do much to live well and to help others live well, within the limits of our condition as human beings and citizens. Above all, we must strive not to be ensnared by greed.

Got it — here’s a tighter, crisper version, still smart but with lighter touches so it doesn’t feel pompous:

Which language should you learn — English, French, Portuguese? Picking one isn’t just about utility. Motivation matters, and beyond careers or study abroad, many of us keep going because we’ve fallen for the sound of a language. Beauty keeps you at it.

So here’s my list of the ten languages I think sound the best — each with a musical example.

---

### 10. German

Distinctive and resonant, as if spoken from the back of the head. Germany gives us more glue, aspirin and cars than pop hits, but also Liszt’s timeless *Liebesträume*.

### 9. Japanese

The only East Asian language I truly enjoy hearing. Seven thousand characters to learn puts me off, but anime gave us unforgettable songs — like the ending theme from *Dragon Ball*.

### 8. Romanian

A Romance language in Eastern Europe, and at risk of fading. The UN even launched a free course to keep it alive. My choice is the mid-2000s hit *Dragostea din Tei* — “The Linden Love”.

### 7. French

Not my personal favourite, but adored worldwide. Half of Africa speaks it, and diplomats once needed it. Nothing captures its mood better than Yves Montand’s *Les Feuilles Mortes*.

### 6. Finnish

Close to Spanish in pronunciation, though otherwise alien. Think Baldor’s algebra read with Miguel Bosé’s voice. For music: Loituma’s *Kun Mun Kultani Tulisi*, from an old love poem.

### 5. Italian

The cousin of Spanish, practically sung rather than spoken. Once dominant in pop, now better known for Andrea Bocelli, Laura Pausini and pianists like Einaudi. My pick: Alessandro Safina’s *Luna*.

### 4. Russian

Unfairly stereotyped as harsh, yet often lilting, almost Italian. From the Soviet era: *Moscow Nights*, sung by Hvorostovsky and Netrebko.

### 3. Hebrew

Ancient, revived in the 20th century as modern Hebrew. A language reborn. Listen to Amir Benayun’s *Professor of Life*.

### 2. English

Flexible, global, and pleasant to the ear — especially in British accents. Example: Lorde’s *Yellow Flicker Beat* from *The Hunger Games*.

### 1. Spanish

Our own language — rich, musical, and in Colombia, famously warm. For me, nothing sums it up better than Carlos Vives’ *La Tierra del Olvido*.

That’s my top ten. Which one would you start with?

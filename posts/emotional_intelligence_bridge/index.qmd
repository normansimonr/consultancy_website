Emotional intelligence (EI) is typically presented as a universal yardstick of emotional competence. According to the canonical definitions—self-awareness, empathy, regulation, and the ability to sustain positive relationships—it is assumed to measure how well one “does emotions.” Yet the concept is far from neutral. As several critics have noted, EI as usually described is deeply embedded in neurotypical norms \[Goleman, CITATION; Petrides, CITATION].

For gifted and neurodivergent individuals, this presents a problem. Their emotional lives are often characterised by intensity, nuance, and existential depth \[Silverman, CITATION; Piechowski, CITATION]. They do not necessarily experience feelings as passing signals to be swiftly regulated but as profound currents tied to meaning, identity, and morality. When the prevailing model of EI privileges smooth social functioning, gifted people find themselves penalised—not for lacking emotional intelligence, but for expressing it in a way that disrupts neurotypical expectations.

## A Thought Experiment: A Country of the Gifted

Let us imagine a society composed entirely of gifted individuals. What would emotional intelligence mean there?

* **Depth over smoothness**: EI would not require blunting intensity for the sake of social ease. Instead, it would reward the ability to *carry deep feelings responsibly*—to express passion or despair without overwhelming others.
* **Complexity tolerance**: Rather than resolving contradictions quickly, EI would mean holding paradoxes in mind and allowing layered emotions to coexist.
* **Authenticity as respect**: Honesty would be a marker of regard. Masking feelings would be seen as evasive, even disrespectful.
* **Meta-reflection**: EI would include connecting emotions to thought structures—seeing grief, for example, as not only sadness but as a response to violated values or existential concerns.
* **Moral sensitivity**: Finally, EI would be judged by one’s ability to translate emotional depth into ethical action—turning empathy into justice or compassion into systemic change.

In such a culture, EI is measured not by the absence of disruption, but by the *quality of one’s engagement with emotional intensity*.

## Neurotypical EI: The Value of Smoothness

In neurotypical-majority societies, emotional intelligence tends to be framed differently. Here, EI is prized for its capacity to preserve social harmony and minimise disruption. Its markers include:

* **Social decoding**: accurately reading cues, tone, and subtext.
* **Adaptive regulation**: modulating emotional expression to maintain comfort.
* **Polite masking**: sometimes hiding or diluting strong emotions to protect relationships.
* **Harmony orientation**: prioritising group stability over individual catharsis or depth.

This orientation is not trivial. Smoothness allows groups to function, conflicts to be contained, and collaboration to proceed. It is no less a form of intelligence than depth. But for those wired to feel differently, smoothness can feel like an *oppressive demand to suppress authenticity*.

## Alienation and Oppression: How Each Experiences the Other

The clash between these two definitions of EI is not merely academic. It plays out daily in classrooms, workplaces, and families.

* **For the gifted**: neurotypical EI can feel oppressive. They may be told that their intensity is “too much,” that their insistence on honesty is “inappropriate,” or that their emotional depth is a burden. In short, they learn that being themselves is a liability. Masking becomes a survival skill, but at the cost of authenticity and wellbeing \[Neihart, CITATION].

* **For the neurotypical majority**: gifted EI can feel alienating. A person who insists on exploring moral implications in the middle of a practical meeting, or who responds to a simple question with existential reflection, risks appearing disruptive. Their authenticity may feel abrasive, their intensity destabilising. What is valued as depth in one framework is experienced as noise in the other.

This mutual misrecognition means that what one group calls “emotional intelligence,” the other may call “emotional incompetence.”

## Examples of EI in Practice

Consider a few scenarios:

* **Gifted EI**: A gifted adolescent, confronted with a friend’s betrayal, responds with philosophical reflection: “I feel hurt, but also confused—why do people value loyalty in words but not in actions? This makes me question the meaning of friendship itself.” To another gifted peer, this is emotionally intelligent: it connects feelings to values and meaning. To a neurotypical teacher, however, it may look like overthinking instead of simply naming feelings.

* **Neurotypical EI**: A manager notices tension in a meeting and quickly cracks a light joke to restore ease, shelving the difficult issue for later. Within a smoothness framework, this is emotionally intelligent—it preserves group function. But to a gifted employee, it may feel like avoidance, even dishonesty.

* **Bridge EI**: A gifted adult, aware of both worlds, acknowledges intensity but translates it for the group: “I feel strongly about this issue because it connects to fairness, which I value deeply. But I’ll keep my comments brief so we can stay on track.” Here, authenticity is retained, but expressed in a way that minimises disruption. This is bilingual emotionality.

## Towards a Bridge Model

The task, then, is not to elevate one model of EI over the other, but to **build a bridge**. True emotional intelligence lies in recognising that different cultures of feeling exist, and learning to translate between them.

* **Gifted EI emphasises**: intensity, authenticity, moral imagination.
* **Neurotypical EI emphasises**: attunement, regulation, harmony.
* **Bridge EI emphasises**: *translation*—knowing when authenticity will clarify and when it will disrupt; knowing when harmony will soothe and when it will oppress.

This bridge is not a compromise but an expansion. It equips gifted individuals to scale their authenticity into digestible forms, while also encouraging neurotypical individuals to tolerate, and even value, emotional depth without pathologising it.

## Conclusion

Emotional intelligence, far from being a single fixed skillset, is better understood as a cultural practice of emotional translation. In one society, EI may mean managing disruption; in another, it may mean honouring depth. For individuals who move between these worlds, the challenge is to cultivate bilingual emotionality—the art of translating intensity into smoothness, and smoothness into depth.

Only then can EI live up to its promise: not as a tool for enforcing conformity, but as a means of *holding space for multiple emotional worlds, and learning how to travel between them.*
